# Georgia Tech Work Orders

This project is an analysis of all maintenance requests accepted by the Georgia Tech Department of Housing since 10/12/2005. This is the earliest time I can find work orders (GH-1185).

I'm not sure what license the actual work order data is under. I have been unable to find any information on the rights related to this data. I'd assume that it's copyright Georgia Tech though.
